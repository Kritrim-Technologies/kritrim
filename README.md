### **Introduction**

Music generation is a very creative problem that tests creative capacity of a composer, whether it a human or a computer. Almost all of music is some alteration of a sonic idea created before. Music contains melodies and harmonies that come in some fixed patterns. With enough data and the correct algorithm, deep learning algorithms should be able to learn these patterns and make music that would sound similar to that composed by human beings. There are various architetures that can be used to solve this problem. LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) can be used to learn more complex and long-term dependencies. Autoencoders and its variants can be used to extract essential features of music and generate new music by decoding the feature set and adding variations to it. A GAN(Generative Adverserial Network) uses an adversarial feedback loop to learn to generate some information that seems real. This project experiments with these various architectures for generating music with objective of generating unique music.
